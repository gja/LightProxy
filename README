== LightProxy ==
This is a lightweight library for generating proxy objects. It aims to be faster than DynamicProxy, with a subset of the features. It only has one mode, proxy an interface with a concrete backing object.

== Examples ==

// Hold onto this object. We emit one assembly per generator.
// This generator can be re-used
var generator = new ProxyGenerator();

IFoo foo = generator(new Foo(), interceptor1, interceptor2);

class Interceptor1 : IInterceptor
{
    public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
    {
        // Do something before
	invocation.Continue();
	// Do something after
    }
}
