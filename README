== LightProxy ==
This is a lightweight library for generating proxy objects. It aims to be faster than DynamicProxy, with a subset of features. It only has one mode, proxy an interface with a concrete backing object.

== Examples ==

// Hold onto this object. We emit one assembly per generator.
var generator = new ProxyGenerator();
IFoo foo = generator(new Foo(), interceptor1, interceptor2);
